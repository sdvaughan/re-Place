Description
------------
An entertaining social experiment where users collaborate on a virtual canvas, using basic shapes and colors. After placing a shape on the canvas, the user will have to wait a predetermined amount of time before interacting with the canvas again. Once a week, the state of the canvas will be saved for future viewing, and the canvas will be reset.

Technologies/Services
----------------------
MySQL database (for storing placed shapes and the IP/user that placed them)
Node.js (might need for Javascript implementation throughout site for database usage)
Google Domains (for domain name)
Personal Server (for web hosting)
